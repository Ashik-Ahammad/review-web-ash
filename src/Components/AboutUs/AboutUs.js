                        Different countries have differing visa systems and acceptance procedures. However, they are usually very similar:
                        <br />
                        To study in the UK you need to have received an offer for a place on a course. You need to prove that you can understand English, including reading, writing and speaking. Find out more about UK Student Visas.
                        <br />
                        To study in the US you need to prove that you have a permanent residence in your country of citizenship. You need to have the funds to support your study and intend to return home once your study is complete. Find out more about US Student Visas.
                        <br />
                        To study in Australia you also need to prove that you have sufficient funds to support your course fees and living costs. You will also be assessed based on the subject you have chosen and your country of citizenship.
                        <br />
                        To study in Europe you do not require a visa if your country of citizenship is an EU member. If you are outside of the EU you should check your chosen destinationâ€™s visa requirements for more specific details.
                        <br />
                        Wherever you chose to study we advise that you apply for your visa as soon as possible.
                        <br />
                        What type of student visa do I need?
                        <br />
                        If you are studying abroad for your post-16 education you will require a general student visa.<br />
                        In the UK this is called a Tier 4 (General Student) visa.<br />
                        In the US this is called a F-1 visa.<br />
                        In Australia your visa type will depend on your country of citizenship and your chosen subject.

                        <p>For any bachelors coursework or for a diploma program, a student needs to have at least a minimum of 5.5 bands in individual modules of the IELTS with the overall band scale not less than a 6.0 pointer.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, for a masters program, a candidate needs to achieve an overall band score of 6.5 [minimum] with no individual band less than a 6.0 pointer.</p>
                        <p>Also, even though most of the doctoral/ post-doctoral course band requirements fall in the same category as those of the masters program, there might be universities which will ask the student to achieve at least a 7.0 band with no individual band less than a 6.5 band, for admissions into a research program.
